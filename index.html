<p>WARNING: do not do it, unless you have read and understood these instructions.
If <em>anything</em> goes wrong during the restore process, you will have to restore
to the latest, most likely unjailbreakable firmware.  Basically, you are on
your own.  I will not be held responsible for anything YOU do.</p>

<p>This works only on certain jailbroken 32bit devices.  By that, I mean devices
I have keys for.  Also, this will <em>not</em> change your baseband.  If you go too
far up/down with iOS version, it may be that the main OS doesn't understand
the baseband anymore.  If that happens, you won't get past activation and
you cannot re-jailbreak the device.  As a consequence, the device will remain
in activation limbo and you'll have to restore.</p>

<p>The untether on your device must have tfp0 enabled.  Early versions of Pangu
did not enable tfp0, but latest versions of Pangu, TaiG and evasi0n all have
tfp0 activated.</p>

<p>You need to have the valid ticket/blob for the desired firmware.  To validate
the ticket/blob against the desired firmware, you have to:
    a) download desired firmware:
        computer$ curl -O http://path/to/desired.ipsw
    b) convert your precious.shsh to xml:
        computer$ cat precious.shsh | zcat -fc &gt; precious.plist
        computer$ plutil -convert xml1 precious.plist
    c) validate the ticket/blob:
        computer$ ./validate precious.plist desired.ipsw -z
If you see any ERROR message, then your ticket/blob is probably screwed and you
should NOT attempt to downgrade.</p>

<p>Install OpenSSH and Core Utilities (coreutils) on the device, using Cydia or
whatever app store is the rage these days.</p>

<p>Save your baseband (enter your device root password, default is alpine):
        computer$ ./sshtool -s baseband.tar -p 22 device_ip_or_name
It's ok if baseband.tar is a zero sized file if you have an Infineon baseband
(that is, &lt;= iPhone4) but for Qualcomm (that is &gt;= iPhone4S), your device must
have the baseband on main filesystem.  In this case, any error or empty archive
means trouble.</p>

<p>Build the custom firmware.  This will take a while.  The -memory parameter is
optional.  Use it only if your machine has sufficient physical memory (&gt;=4GB).
Make sure you have the right bundle in FirmwareBundles/.  If the bundle is not
there, ask for it.
        computer$ ./ipsw desired.ipsw custom.ipsw -memory baseband.tar
or
        computer$ ./ipsw desired.ipsw custom.ipsw -memory baseband.tar jb.tar ssh.tar
The latter is meant to save your device if there's a baseband mismatch.  Do NOT
attempt to install Cydia (jailbreak or otherwise) over it even if signal works.
Its sole purpose is to allow you to re-downgrade to a different iOS version.
If the ipsw creation fails, try increasing rootfs with <code>-s' or</code>-S' options.</p>

<p>Extract back the pwned iBSS from the custom-built firmware:
        computer$ ./xpwntool <code>unzip -j custom.ipsw 'Firmware/dfu/iBSS*' | awk '/inflating/{print $2}'</code> pwnediBSS</p>

<p>Kickstart the pwned restore (enter your device root password):
        computer$ ./sshtool -k ../kloader -b pwnediBSS -p 22 device_ip_or_name</p>

<p>Wait for the device to enter DFU.  Do NOT press any button.  Just plug/unplug
it, until it is seen as DFU.  If it does not appear, do a cold boot by holding
both Home and Power button until the Apple logo appears and then repeat the
previous step.  Kill iTunes before continuing.  You may want to disable iTunes
Helper by removing it from System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Groups -&gt; Login Items
or simply kill it:
        computer$ killall iTunesHelper</p>

<p>Restore the custom firmware.  Make sure you have your precious ticket/blob file
copied as shsh/ECID-DEVICE-VERSION.shsh before starting.  For example, the shsh
file can be 2144637826347-iPad3,1-7.1.2.shsh.  Please note that you may need to
be root to access USB:
        computer# ./idevicerestore -d -w custom.ipsw</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>In theory, the last step can be replaced by starting TinyUmbrella and doing the
restore via iTunes, but I have not tested it that way (and most probably, you'd
have to downgrade iTunes).</p>
